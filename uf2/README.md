# PicoCalc-uf2
I compiled all the uf2 files from the PicoCalc github so you don't have to.

uLisp is not done yet, I am still working on it.

I do not have a PicoCalc yet, so if you have trouble with any of these, open an issue on it and let me know.

Update 3-25-2025

I got the uLisp code to compile, and uploaded it.

Update 3-26-2025

I moved all the uf2 images I compiled to their own folder, so I could make room for my own projects.

Update 4-3-2025

I added a uLisp and PicoMite uf2 images for the Pico 2. If you are interested in other versions of uLisp uf2, goto this [website](https://dev.metacircular.net/). Thank you guu and picolisper from the Clockworkpi forums for building these uLisp images.
