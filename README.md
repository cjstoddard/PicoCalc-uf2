# PicoCalc-uf2
I am compiling all the uf2 files from the PicoCalc github so you don't have to.

uLisp is not done yet, I am still working on it.

I do not have a PicoCalc yet, so if you have trouble with any of these, open an issue on it and let me know.

Update 3-25-2025

I got the uLisp code to compile, and uploaded it.
