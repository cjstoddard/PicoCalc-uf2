# PicoCalc-uf2

Originally I created this github to store the latest uf2 images for the PicoCalc, so there was one consolidated place where someone could go and get what they needed. This turned out to be a bad idea. Once the PicoCalc community go going, there was just too many inputs to keep up with. Both the PicoMite and the MicroPython images were having multple updates per day. Then hunting down images for uLisp and a couple of others was just too much work. So I decided to give up that endeavor and do what I do.

Now this is a repository of my own screwing around code. This is pretty much a hodge podge of ideas that caught my fancy. I own two PicoCalc devices, one with PicoMite Basic and the other with MicroPython, while uLisp and Lua have some interesting possibilities, I am not really interested in flashing my PicoCalc devices every other day, so I am just going to stick with what I have.

Stay gold, Ponyboy!
