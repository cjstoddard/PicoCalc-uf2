# PicoCalc-uf2

Update 4-26-2025
I now have two PicoCalc devices. I tried putting a LuckFox Lyra into it and seeing how Linux felt on it. I got the results I expected, the Lyra plus PicoCalc configuration is too underpowered for reasonable use as a Linux device, even when just using the command line. I do not recomend this configuration excepting to do anything super useful, you are better off getting a Hackberry Pi Zero.

So, I swapped in a Pico 2 W and flashed the firmware with MicroPython. With that, I moved all the Basic files to the PicoMite folder and added a MicroPython folder to seperate out the work I am doing on each device. I also removed the uf2 folder, I doubt anyone found it useful and frankly it was too much trouble to maintain current builds of some of those projects.
