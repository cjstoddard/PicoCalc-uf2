# PicoCalc-uf2

I compiled all the uf2 files from the PicoCalc github so you don't have to. I do not have a PicoCalc yet, so if you have trouble with any of these, open an issue on it and let me know. These uf2 images are in the uf2 folder.

I have started work on updating some other programs I have for the PicoCalc. These programs are not functional yet, since I do not yet have a PicoCalc, I have no way to test them yet. I have not adjusted for screen size or pins for the sensors.

Update 4-4-2025
I added an updated version of Hamurabi.bas.

Update 4-8-2025
Picocalc-dht22.bas works now. Picocalc-dht22-2.bas works, but the gauges do not render properly, I suspect this is a bug in the PicoCalc version of PicoMite for the pico 2. I have not tested a bme280 yet, Picocalc-bme280.bas may still not work.
