# Tomato

This program is the third or fourth interneration of my Micropython Tomato program and the PicoMite Basic Picogotchi program. The idea behind all of these programs is to emulate Radical Edwards Tomato Computer Tomato, from the Cowboy Bebop franchise. While working on this project in its various form, I came across some pretty cool images for skinning a Pwnagotchi devices into a Tomato like way.

This is one of those projects where I have developed a silly little UI, but I have no idea what the program should actually do. So this is a blank slate for you. There are plenty of mood faces to use to give your program some personality.
