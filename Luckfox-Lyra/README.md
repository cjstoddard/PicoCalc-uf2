# PicoCalc Lyra Linux

If you are here looking for advice on using the PicoCalc with a Luckfox Lyra, my first huge piece of advice is skip straight to the Luckfox Ubuntu page and ignore everything else. The Ubuntu image is reasonably easy to get into a usable state. The hisptoot image is a serious pain in the ass, I would not recomend it unless you have a very specific use case for it.

The other pages are all about getting Hisptoot's PicoCalc Lyra Linux (PCL Linux) image into a usable state and, extend the usefulness of PCL Linux, because lets face it, the basic install is very limited. If all you want to do is play some retro games and program in Python, it is probably fine. However if you want to do other things, a lot of work needs to be done.
