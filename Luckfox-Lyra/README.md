# PicoCalc Lyra Linux

Putting a Luckfox Lyra in a PicoCalc and installing PicoCalc Lyra Linux (PCL Linux) is one of the more interesting and flexible modifications you can make to a PicoCalc. Using this tinu Linux environment, lets you do pretty much everything you would want to do with the PicoCalc, without having to flash the device.

With these pages, my goal is to help other people extend the usefulness of PCL Linux, because lets face it, the basic install is fairly limited. If all you want to do is play some retro games and program in Python, it is probably fine. However if you want to do other things, a bit of work needs to be done.
